# How to contribute
To contribute to this project, clone this repo and make a PR request. Contributions of any kind are greatly welcomed and appreciated!

# Important Note
It is generally best practice to include CSS, JS, and HTML files seperately in a project. This is a practice that will always work well. However, in this repository, all site data is handled through HTML files only. This is due to the way the webserver handles updates in CSS and JS files. We are currently in a migration towards seperated files, though that is not a priority right now.

# Thank you!
Thank you to everyone that has assisted with the journey of LearnForsyth. It has been an amazing year and we could not have done it without our contributors - from our amazing, dedicated volounteer tutors to our extremely involved and hard-working interns. We could have never reached the goal of **350**+ students tutored without their help. Thank you.
